H5P is a WordPress plugin for creating and sharing rich HTML5 content in your browser.

== Description ==

H5P makes it easy to create and share HTML5 content and applications. H5P empowers creatives to create rich
and interactive web experiences in Wordpress more efficiently.

With the H5P plugin you may create interactive videos, interactive presentations, quizzes, image hotspots
and many other types of interactive HTML5 content. Content may be created using the built in authoring
tool or by uploading H5P files containing content others have created.

The content may be inserted into your posts and pages using shortcodes, like this `[h5p id="1"]`.
Whenever you get a new H5P library this enables you to start creating rich content of a new type using this library,
i.e. if you download [Interactive Video](http://h5p.org/interactive-video) and upload in your WordPress, you may create
your own interactive videos.
