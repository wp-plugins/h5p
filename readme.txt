H5P is a WordPress plugin for creating and sharing rich HTML5 content in your browser.

== Description ==

H5P makes it easy to create and share HTML5 content and applications. H5P empowers creatives to create rich 
and interactive web experiences more efficiently - all you need is a web browser and a web site with an H5P plugin.

After installing this plugin, you may upload .h5p files containing both HTML5 libraries and content. The content
may be inserted into you posts and pages using shortcodes, like this `[h5p id="1"]`.
Whenever you get a new H5P library this enables you to start creating rich content of a new type using this library, 
i.e. if you download [Interactive Video](http://h5p.org/interactive-video) and upload in your WordPress, you may create
your own interactive videos.
